						<p>In the next few lines, I intend to give some background on my work, paintings and, more explicitly cooperative works as well. First, I would like to describe my interests – inspirations, then to give some insight on the process of the creation, and why this kind of creative process suits me and my intentions the most.</p>

						<p>In my work, I am most interested in initiating a conversation about the unspeakable.
							I get inspired by some sort of intensity, something that has an articulate physical sensual effect on me. These experiences, these impacts that I process through my art, are just like anyone else's, they are every-day life experiences – so to speak –universal.</p>
						<p>Emotions are feelings perceived by the body, and thus they are transmitted as physical data to the cognition. Before the mentalisation, I find that there is a field of possibilities, which is why it is also called the Transitional Space (Winnicott 1951). When I work, I linger in this space and I pursue to keep the incoming data in this unprocessed, unmentalised form for as long as possible to be able to analyse them in a different way, a non mental way. After, I search for other physical equivalents that are somehow similar in nature to the original.* These equivalents (colours, forms, symbols-signs, material) add up to create another form of physical reality, that is, the artwork. In this process in the transitional, a certain kind of personal crystallisation takes place. To give an example, I would say it is like the making of a soup. You have the ingredients, the process, the circumstances of creation. You may use the same ingredients, but in different quantity or quality. You may have the same process, but the circumstances will be different each time. No one can ever make the same soup twice. What I especially like about this metaphor, is that it is not only different each time, but it is also very personal.</p>

						<p>These intensities – unspeakables – are very articulate and specific. Still, it's hard to express them in words. Or, if tried, it feels like something has been lost on the way. This is where visual and sensual creation has, in my experience, its essential role.
							We have a very verbal and conceptual culture nowadays, so it's a relief for me to leave all this behind and "think" and "speak" by this sensual way about all that matters to me. The different phases of this no-interpretation-process, no-evaluation-process, my working process, provide me with the perspective of all kinds of adventures. Since the job is basically about finding the best equivalents, it is investigation and archaeology. Nevertheless, the use of the brush is inevitable.</p>

						<p>This process of creation brings with itself the basic property of the object defining the style, not me.
							Style is basically the portrait of the artist, and I am more interested in the things outside of me, rather than myself, simply because there are more interesting, intriguing, engaging things out there. Of course, I am also part of this, as it is my choice to use this process.</p>

						<p>I relate to all of my artworks as paintings, be it an installation, a process exhibition or collective psychodramatic art experience. The sensual nature of the painting is my home, where I originate. However, I can adapt the security of "all is well", "all is working out", "the components that have to be there will turn up", "it is as it is" – feeling to other situations as well. Prepare with exhilaration, focus with faith and wait with brush in the hand. Timing is the most important element in the equation. However, in my experience, no good timing is possible without thorough preparation and clear focus.
							The main difference between a painting, an installation, a cooperative exhibition and group art, is in the nature of the conversation between the participants. In a way, none of my works are finished, all of them are undone. In case of the paintings, they are objects first, which are in a conversation with whoever is watching them. They are undone by themselves as they only represent one side of the conversation. As a result, it is not such a good idea to give them titles, as they narrow down the associations of the viewer. On the other hand, I do have to identify my works somehow. I may give them numbers, but then the numbers would already influence the interpretation.</p>

						<p>Besides the viewer, another participant is the environment: other objects, space, light etc. engaged in conversation with the painting. I make them purposefully undone. In the case of process exhibitions, this is obviously part of that framework, however, I also do this in all of my work. Not too much undone but a little undone. It is a nice challenge.</p>

						<p>The transfiguration of physical information (feeling) into physical (art) is not new at all. It might be as old as the cave paintings. This transfiguration is a language, which has a long history. It can be spoken and understood in a sophisticated way, but its not necessary to have any prior knowledge. As this is physical information most of all, all of us are capable of receiving it (it actually takes more effort not to receive). In my experience, sometimes prior cultural knowledge (over-reflectivity) just complicates the perception and can also result in resistance.</p>
						<p>I enjoy very much being part of this history, finding my mates among the deceased and my contemporaries is a joyful and satisfying everyday pleasure. Even more enjoyable is looking at artworks from all times and all corners of the world as tools: possible visual components which I may use for creating my own artwork. It feels good to love art but it also feels good not to look at its objects as untouchable fetishes. Instead, I look at them as substance. This perspective also has the benefit of giving me the best position with the most potential to live and create in.</p>
						<p>* This reminds me of what Thomas Hobbes wrote in Leviathan (1651): “The universe, the whole mass of things that are, is corporeal, that is to say, body, and hath the dimensions of magnitude, length, breadth and depth. Every part of the universe is ‘body’ and that which is not ‘body’ is no part of the universe, and because the universe is all, that which is no part of it is nothing, and consequently nowhere.”</p>
